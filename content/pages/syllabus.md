Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 3 sessions / week, 1 hour / session

Recitations: 1 session / week, 1 hour / session

Description
-----------

6.720 examines the physics of microelectronic semiconductor devices for silicon integrated circuit applications. Topics covered include: semiconductor fundamentals, p-n junction, metal-oxide semiconductor structure, metal-semiconductor junction, MOS field-effect transistor, and bipolar junction transistor. The course emphasizes physical understanding of device operation through energy band diagrams and short-channel MOSFET device design. Issues in modern device scaling are also outlined.

Prerequisite
------------

The prerequisites for this course are 6.012 Microelectronic Devices and Circuits or 3.42 Electronic Materials Design or equivalent.

Level
-----

H-level graduate subject, 12 units, 2 engineering design points.

Assignments
-----------

There will be 9 homeworks, 3 device characterization projects (PN diode, MOSFET, BJT), and one device design project. See the calendar for information on due dates.

Exams
-----

There will be two quizzes and one final exam. Quiz 1 will cover Ses #L1-L12 and will take place one day after Ses #L16. Quiz 2 will cover Ses #L13-L24 and will take place one day after Ses #L25.

The final exam will cover all material but will emphasize Ses #L25-L39. It will take place during final exam week. The time and location will be decided by the Registrar. All exams are open book and a calculator is required.

Collaboration Policy
--------------------

In all take-home exercises of this subject (homework, device characterization projects, design project) you may collaborate with another student in this class. In fact, collaboration is encouraged. However, **these are not group projects** to be divided among several participants. Every individual must carry out every exercise in its entirety. Every one of the items of each exercise contains a substantial educational experience. If you collaborate with another student in any exercise, please prominently show in your solutions the name of your collaborator. Violations of this policy will be handled by MIT's Committee on Discipline. If you have questions regarding this policy, please ask the instructor.

Late Assignment Policy
----------------------

Assignments are due at lecture on the designated date. Late homework is acceptable at the following lecture session after it is due (50% of credit only). No credit for homework later than this. Special cases can only be handled by lecturer.
